# Predicting Employee Churn For Salifort Motors

## Overview
Salifort Motors currently has a high turnover rate among employees and is concerned because they make a big investment in recruiting, training and upskilling it's employees.
Salifort Motors is seeking a method to use employee data to gauge what makes them leave the company and their reasons behind their departure. The method used to solve thier issue is a predictive model that can classify whether or not an employee will leave. For this task, I chose to build and evaluate two different models, a Logistic Regression Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier. I then compared the two based on their performace and transparency, to allow Salifort Motors to choose the best model for their needs. While the Logistic model exemplifies the most transparent model, the Random Forest Classifier performed the best.
